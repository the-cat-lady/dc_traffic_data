# dc_traffic_data

### Capstone project to demonstrate data selection, EDA, and modeling

I used a dataset from https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=70392a096a8e431381f1f692aaa06afd to study accidents in metro DC, and try to draw conclusions.

An interesting library I used to create interactive plots is [gmplot](https://github.com/vgm64/gmplot), which helped make my presentation engaging.
